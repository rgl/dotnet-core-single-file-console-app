      PublishTrimmed will trim the application dependencies to include only what is actually used by the application.
      NB if you use reflection you might need to configure which assemblies/types/methods need to be included, e.g.:
          <ItemGroup>
            <TrimmerRootAssembly Include="My.Assembly.Full.Name" />
          </ItemGroup>
    -->

    <!--
      PublishSingleFile creates a single exe with the application binaries.
      At runtime it first extracts the contents to %TEMP%\.net\<exe filename>\<some hash>, e.g.:
        C:\Users\RUILOP~1\AppData\Local\Temp\.net\SingleFileConsoleApp\2jejrexs.5y3
      and executes from there.
      NB there is nothing removing those temporary directories... so the user has to manage them himself.
